TLDR: don't put complicated scripts in crontab. Instead, write a shell script and have cron execute it.

When I had a complicated pgrep command to check if my misting scripts were running,
the crontab wouldn't actually execute the python script. the solve was to write a shell script that did the same thing and also logged everything for debugging
