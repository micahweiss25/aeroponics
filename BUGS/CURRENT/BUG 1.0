BLUF: at least one switch must be on

DESCRIPTION: After the connections are made and the first GPIO pin is set to low (activating the relay switch), you cannot turn the corrisponding
relay switch back off unless another switch is turned on.

POSSIBLE SOURCE: 
1. COMMON GROUND: The GPIO pin cannot be set back to low (creating a ground) because the relay switch and GPIO pins don't
  share a common ground. To turn the relay switch off, the GPIO pin goes to zero.
    - TEST: 
    connect multimeter to base pin on pi and GPIO pin of interest
    ```
    connect(BASE)
    connect(ACID)
    test(BASE, 1)
    test(BASE, 0) * expected behavior (EB): base pump doesn't turn off. GPIO pin reads non-zero volts despite being set to low.
    test(ACID, 1) *EB: acid pump turns on. corresponding gpio pin reads non-zero volts. base pump turns off. pin now reads zero volts. 
    ```
    connect relay switch power and ground to pi instead of buck converter (5v pins) and run the same test again. 
    
2. SUFFICIENT POWER: The pi doesn't have enough power to keep every switch high. Some pins' voltage drop below relay's threshold thus reading low signal
and activating. I don't think this is the issue because the pi would brown out instead of failing to ground a pin.
